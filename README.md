# Project2ML
To make the code compile, add a folder named "test_set_images" with test images and another folder "training" containing "images" and "groundtruth" subfolders. I couldn't upload them to GitHub, so please add them yourself.

Ensuring Data Reproducibility:
The "run.py" code should ideally compile seamlessly, generating the submitted results on AI Crowd. If any issues arise, please consult the Google Colab link, as we utilized this platform for collaborative work on the project.
